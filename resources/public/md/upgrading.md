## Upgrading to the Latest Version

Unfortunately, there is no automated process for upgrading an older version of the framework to the latest release.
This is due to the fact that newer versions of dependencies may have breaking changes and the code generated by
the template will likely have been modified to fit the needs of your site.

The good news is that the Luminus template is fairly stable and there aren't likely to be any major changes down the
road. However, there will be more profiles added down the road, and the dependencies will be updated to the latest stable versions.

You could use the following script to keep the dependencies for your project up to date:

```clojure
(ns version-checker
  (:require [clj-http.client :as client]))
 
(def projects
  ["https://raw.github.com/yogthos/Selmer/master/project.clj"
   "https://raw.github.com/noir-clojure/lib-noir/master/project.clj"
   "https://raw.github.com/weavejester/compojure/master/project.clj"
   "https://raw.github.com/weavejester/hiccup/master/project.clj"
   "https://raw.github.com/weavejester/lein-ring/master/project.clj"
   "https://raw.github.com/ptaoussanis/timbre/master/project.clj"
   "https://raw.github.com/ptaoussanis/tower/master/project.clj"
   "https://raw.github.com/yogthos/markdown-clj/master/project.clj"
   "https://raw.github.com/weavejester/lein-ring/master/project.clj"
   "https://raw.github.com/weavejester/ring-mock/master/project.clj"
   "https://raw.github.com/mmcgrana/ring/master/ring-devel/project.clj"
   "https://raw.github.com/korma/Korma/master/project.clj"])

(defn get-project-version [url]
  (let [resp (client/get url)]
    (if (= "text/plain; charset=utf-8" (get (:headers resp) "content-type"))
      (binding [*read-eval* false]
        (->> resp :body read-string rest (take 2)))
      (println "error fetching project file for" url))))
 
(defn versions []
  (for [url projects]
    (get-project-version url)))
 
(doseq [[id version] (versions)]
  (println id version))
