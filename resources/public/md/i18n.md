## Internationalization

Luminius template comes with [Tower](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/tower) dependency which
provides you functionality for internationalization and
translation. You are able to use a ring middleware

```clojure
(def app
 (app-handler
   [routes]
   :middleware
   [taoensso.tower.ring/wrap-tower-middleware]))             
```

The middleware will use the `accept-language` header to infer the preferred locale for the client.
The middleware will append two keys to the request. The first key is `:t` and it points to the function that
handles the translations. The second key is `:locale` and it points to the locale that was inferred
by the middleware.

It's also possible to supply a custom `locale-selector` function to the middleware:

```clojure
(defn my-selector [req]
  (when (= (:remote-addr req) "127.0.0.1") :en))
  
(def app
  (app-handler
    [routes]
    :middleware
    [#(wrap-tower-middleware % {:locale-selector my-selector})]))
```

The locale middleware will use the first available locale from the following options:

```clojure
(:locale request)
(when-let [ls locale-selector] (ls request))
(:locale session)
(:locale params)
(locale-from-headers headers)
fallback-locale
```

Alternatively, you can use `with-locale` macro to set up your locale explicitly:

```clojure
(with-locale :en (t :example/greeting "Steve")) => "Hello Steve, how are you?"
```

More information is available on the [Github](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/tower) page for the project.
