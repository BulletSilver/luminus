## About Luminus

Luminus is built on top of [Ring](https://github.com/mmcgrana/ring), [Compojure](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure), 
[lib-noir](https://github.com/noir-clojure/lib-noir), and [lib-luminus](https://github.com/yogthos/lib-luminus). These libraries 
provide the core functionality of the applications. It ties these libraries together and attempts to provide a simple and consistent 
environment for building your applications.

Unlike traditional frameworks, Luminus leaves most deicisions up to the user and does not enforce any one way of building applications.
Instead, it aims to provide good starting defaults via the application template on top of which the rest of the application can be built.
